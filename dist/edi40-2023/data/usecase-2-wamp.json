This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359.

In versions prior to 1.5.0 or 2.1.1, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML CDATA sections cannot be filtered and sanitized due to a parsing issue in the upstream package masterminds/html5. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of typo3/html-sanitizer. The upstream package masterminds/html5 provides HTML raw text elements (`script`, `style`, `noframes`, `noembed` and `iframe`) as DOMText nodes, which were not processed and sanitized further. None of the mentioned elements were defined in the default builder configuration, that's why only custom behaviors, using one of those tag names, were vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

Users with administrative access to affected hosts may use this to create a new command prompt as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

They must also be able to install the tools required to trigger the issue. This issue does not affect the CloudWatch Agent for macOS or Linux. Agent users should upgrade to version 1.247355 of the CloudWatch Agent to address this issue. There is no recommended work around.
