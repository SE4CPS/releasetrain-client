    <h3>Software Engineering in IoT Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>Connectivity enabled and portable technology has been available on a large scale over the last decades. Connectivity of everyday things has seen a growth since then. Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as health care, automotive, retail, and e-mobility are among others at the center of this trend. IoT domains aim to improve tasks related to everyday things. The development of an IoT ecosystem production ready software product requires among others many different and changing: component stakeholders, third party components, component tests in different contexts, and component maintenance tasks. Software engineers are at the center of meeting these dynamic IoT ecosystem requirements, which includes frequent: component stakeholder change requests, third party component interface changes, fixes of context related component bugs, and updates of already released components. Software engineers are in charge of applying the right processes, tools, and architectures that allow them to transparently communicate and effectively adapt an IoT ecosystem. This workshop invites for papers to processes, tools, and architectures to software engineering in IoT ecosystems.</p>
